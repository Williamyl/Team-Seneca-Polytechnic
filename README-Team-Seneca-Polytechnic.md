## 👋 Introduction - Let’s Do This ⚡️!
---

It is Friday, July 26th, 2024 `[ 10:nn pm ]`. Exactly 14 hours with some number of minutes and milliseconds from the time I created this WhatsApp community.

A warm welcome to **EACH** and **EVERYONE** of you—thank **YOU** so much for joining me, for joining us on this eternal journey!

This community is dedicated for students enrolled at Seneca Polytechnic; more specifically, students who are enrolled with the School of Software Design and Data Science `sdds`.

You ALL have my absolute permission if you want to invite whoever else is interested in joining us whether they are Seneca students or not as long as their intentions are pure, and they do not come join us to cause any trouble—we don’t want that here 😀!

I and others in this group here have `0.00%` tolerance against discrimination—If I notice, or I am informed that someone is being disrespectful to `>= 1` person and your reasons are unjustified or they are not valid—congratulations, ***YOU ARE OFFICIALLY KICKED OUT OF THIS GROUP***. I am really confident that nothing of this nature will happen—specially not if we’re students’ at Seneca, right everyone 😁?

My promise to YOU is that this community is a **safe, inclusive** space **to connect, collaborate, grow, and learn** for **EVERYONE, ANYWHERE**. Please, help me fulfill this promise 😁!

## 🤔 Who I am?
---

I think most people who have already joined this WhatsApp community know me by now since I have already had interactions with with all of you—but in case that someone else invited you to this community, and I haven’t interacted with you (or even worst yet: you forgot who I was 😢) the following is a brief autobiography of myself:

My name is Wei Liang (yes, with a space in between)—but I prefer people calling me just "Wei" because it is pronounced the exact the same way as the word "way". So enough instances of the word "way" for now…I am a CPA student just like some of you (because I know that some of you are in `CPP` for C++ 😉) who is going into his second year of studies. If you were wondering if I am at God level in programming—no I am not (at least not yet ), and in fact, as of right now, I think I suck at coding—but the thing that’s going on for me is my unconditional love for science and technology (don’t worry everyone—you will all soon get invited to the wedding 💒) which keeps me learning and pursuing these fields day in and day out with all of my love and passion because I want to discover, appreciate, and apply the beauty underlying these marvellous fields to make a positive difference not just in myself, but also for other with others in every step of the journey 😁!

## 👀 My Vision in Creating This WhatsApp Community for Seneca Polytechnic’s IT Students
---

When I created this group—I had the following vision:

To connect with each other to heights that not even you knew were possible to reach and to collaborate together on GitHub on cool, fabulous new products that can have a positive impact for others whether it is for other fellow students, companies, researches, entrepreneurs, etc. Let’s make an impact in ALL of them through science; mathematics; and of course, programming!

## 🌱 Some of My Goals For This Community
---

The following are some of my initial goals for this WhatsApp community:

* 💎 To respectfully share with each other knowledge about programming and other fields.
* 🤝 To facilitate others in grasping the big picture behind the things taught in programming and even other fields.
* 😎 To come up with ideas for cool coding projects and make them a reality by collaborating on GitHub.
* ✨ To help yourself and others appreciate the beauty of computer programming and other fields.
* 🥰 To have fun by being in community!

## 🚀⭐️ What Will We Be Doing on the Early Stages of This WhatsApp Community?
---

We will slowly be building this WhatsApp community and hopefully expand our empire to other social media, such as Discord, soon in the near future. Since we’re just starting things out this community might completely SUCK at first—but that’s okay…we will be improving and compounding as a function of time `I(t)`.

> In the early stages of this WhatsApp community, we will get to know each other if we haven’t done so, and we interchange knowledge and great ideas, insights with others.

## 💡 Some Next Steps From Me
---

* 👌 I will `git mv` the name of our community group: "Introducing Team Seneca Polytechnic" to just "Team Seneca Polytechnic 🇨🇦”.
* 📸 I will upload a picture of Seneca Polytechnic to the WhatsApp community from my photo library (once I go to there and actually take a good photo). In case that you have a better picture (or any picture as of right now)—please, DM me with the picture, and I might use it to represent the WhatsApp community. Thank you for your cooperation 😊.
* ➕ I will be creating the following three `new` group chats and store the address of the first element in a dynamic `chats` array (they should all be created by the time you’re reading this):
    * 🧊🔨 `Break The Ice`. Dedicated for YOU to get to know your fellow friends! Everyone wants to be your friend—the only thing though is that you have go first!!
    * ⭐️ `Something About Me`: Dedicated for YOU to share something from YOU that makes you stand out from the rest.
    * ❤️ `Sharing Is Caring`. Dedicated for YOU to share what you know or what you have learned, with others.
    * 🤨 `Q&A`. Confused? Need help with something? You have arrived at your stop—don’t forget to tap off your PRESTO or Visa/Debit card if you took ***GO Transit*** 🙂.

## 😀 Some Next Steps For YOU
---

* Join the **“Break The Ice”** group chat in our community. **REMINDER**: Don’t be shy because we **ALL** want to be your friend—the only thing though is that you have to go first!
* Even though you might not realize the following: we all have something that makes us different from others, that makes us stand out. If you had already discovered that something, please share it with us in the **”Something About Me”** group chat. Alternatively, if you feel comfortable, you can share with us a failure or setback you had or an embarrassing moment you experienced on that same chat so that we can be build trust among ourselves more effectively and efficiently.

## 😌👌 Summary
---

🌎 This WhatsApp community has its foundations on building a safe space for connecting, learning and growing for EVERYONE, ANYWHERE. Please, be respectful with your fellow friends…we are all in the same boat together trying to make a positive difference in our lives and hopefully also in the lives of others.

## ✨💫 Conclusion
---

☑️ Challenge Accepted?

You all won’t believe how excited I am for this community to slowly prosper each day and I really hope that everyone is as excited as I am for this **new chapter of our lives**.

Looking forward to celebrate one day with a huge pizza party in which all of you are invited, all of the successes that you all will be accomplishing throughout these upcoming years.

✏️📋‼️ **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE #2:** please do not come to our WhatsApp community asking for the whole solutions of workshops and projects of 144, 244, 345, or any other IT course given at Seneca. Instead, how about if you go to those magical GitHub repository where a Bob who passed all of his courses with A+ made all of his work public for some reason or ChatGPT (if you are actually putting effort in the program and in learning to code). We are willing to help you if you get stuck on a certain part considering that you have already done your work.

In the worst scenario, **you will get kicked out of the group**. Usually through what you will be receive is a `warning` ; and to silence all `warning`(s), please abide by the rules and do not ask for the whole solutions of workshops or projects of IT courses offered at Seneca.

### From the bottom of my heart ❤️,
